Configuration Files \+:

-\/\+The \hyperlink{class_cool_board}{Cool\+Board} A\+PI heavily uses the S\+P\+I\+F\+FS for storing and retreiving configuration and data files

This is a description of the configuration files and what are they used for \+:

1/cool\+Board\+Config.\+json \+:

log\+Interval\+: The time Interval to wait,in seconds, between two logs

irene\+Active\+: Put this flag to 1(true) if you are using the \hyperlink{class_irene3000}{Irene3000} module

sleep\+Active\+: Put this flag to 1(true) if you want your \hyperlink{class_cool_board}{Cool\+Board} to enable Sleep mode In Sleep Mode \+: your \hyperlink{class_cool_board}{Cool\+Board} will do the following \+: -\/read\+Sensors -\/activate Actors(if any) -\/log the data -\/check for updates -\/go to sleep for log\+Interval period of time

user\+Active\+:Put this flag to 1(true) if you want your \hyperlink{class_cool_board}{Cool\+Board} to collect user\+Data \+: user\+Name \hyperlink{class_cool_board}{Cool\+Board} M\+AC Address Time\+Stamp

manual /!\textbackslash{} \+: Put this flag to 1(true) to control to turn on/off your actors and bypass your initial actors configuration \begin{DoxyVerb}         Be Careful with this mode!!.

         When this mode is actif , the CoolBoard will not restart automatically to apply any new configuration sent via
         the update method.

         Restarting the coolBoard when in manual mode will deactivate all the actors!

\subsubsection*{Contribution guidelines}

For minor fixes of code and documentation, please go ahead and submit a pull request.

Larger changes (rewriting parts of existing code from scratch, adding new functions to the core, adding new libraries) should generally be discussed by opening an issue first.

Feature branches with lots of small commits (especially titled \char`\"{}oops\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}fix typo\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}forgot to add file\char`\"{}, etc.) should be squashed before opening a pull request. At the same time, please refrain from putting multiple unrelated changes into a single pull request.

\subsubsection*{License and credits}

All files under src/internal are modified versions of existing libraries. All Credit of the original work goes to their respective authors.

All Other files are provided as is under {\itshape insert License here} . We can only gurantee that we did our best to have everything working on our side.
