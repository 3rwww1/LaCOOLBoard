### What is this repository for? ###

Quick summary : 

CoolBoard API is a set of libraries and wrappers to simplify the access and usage of all 
the capabilites of the CoolBoard.

Version : 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

Configuration :
 
 1/Download and Install the Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software )
 
 2/Download and Add the ESP8266 Hardware extension to Arduino (https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino )
 
 3/Download and Add the CoolBoard Library set to the Arduino IDE :

   a)First Method :
   
   -Open the Arduino IDE
	
   -Go to the "Sketch" Menu 
  
   -Include Library > Manage Libraries. 
  
   -Search for CoolBoard
   
   -Install
   
   -Restart Arduino IDE
   
   
   b)Second Method (if you have a CoolBoard.zip file ):
   
   -Open the Arduino IDE
   
   -Go to the "Sketch" Menu 
    
   -Include Library > "Add .ZIP Library". 
   
   -Search for CoolBoard.zip 
   
   -Click Open
   
   -Restart Arduino IDE
   
   
   
   c)Third Method (if you have the bitbucket/github link):
   
   -Open Arduino IDE > File > Preferences
   
   -Check the "SketchBook Location" path
   
   -Go to the Arduino/libraries folder (if it doesn't exist, create one )
   
   -Clone the repo there ( git clone "bitbucket/github link" )
   
   -Restart Arduino IDE
   
   
 4/Download ESP8266FS Tool (https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/filesystem.html#uploading-files-to-file-system)
 
 5/Optional but Heavily Recommended : Download the ESP8266 Exception Decoder ( download link :https://github.com/me-no-dev/EspExceptionDecoder/releases/tag/1.0.6)
   Install guide : https://github.com/me-no-dev/EspExceptionDecoder
   
   
   
Dependencies :

You need the following libraries to be able to use the CoolBoard API:

-ArduinoJson(https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson)

-NeoPixelBus(https://github.com/Makuna/NeoPixelBus)

-TimeLib(https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Time)

-DS1337RTC(https://github.com/etrombly/DS1337RTC)

-DallasTemperature(https://github.com/milesburton/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library)



Configuration Files :

-The CoolBoard API heavily uses the SPIFFS for storing and retreiving configuration and data files

This is a description of the configuration files and what are they used for :
  
  1/coolBoardConfig.json :
  
    logInterval: The time Interval to wait,in seconds, between two logs
	
    ireneActive: Put this flag to 1(true) if you are using the Irene3000 module
	
    jetpackActive:Put this flag to 1(true) if you are using the Jetpack modue
	
    externalSensorsActive: Put this flag to 1(true) if you are using a supported external Sensor
    
	sleepActive: Put this flag to 1(true) if you want your CoolBoard to enable Sleep mode
                 In Sleep Mode : your CoolBoard will do the following : -readSensors
                                                        				-activate Actors(if any)
																		-log the data
																		-check for updates
																		-go to sleep for logInterval period of time
	             
    userActive:Put this flag to 1(true) if you want your CoolBoard to collect userData : userName
																						 CoolBoard MAC Address 
																						 TimeStamp
                                                                                         
    manual /!\ : Put this flag to 1(true) to control to turn on/off your actors and bypass your initial actors configuration
                 
                 Be Careful with this mode!!.
                 
                 When this mode is actif , the CoolBoard will not restart automatically to apply any new configuration sent via
                 the update method.
                 
                 Restarting the coolBoard when in manual mode will deactivate all the actors!
                 
                 Never forget to reset this to 0(false) to go back to normal mode!

	Act[i].temporal:Put this flag to 1(true) if you want the actor to be actif of a period of time  ,
					then inactif for another period of time ( this mode doesn't consider measurments at the moment )
						
	Act[i].type:["primaryType","secondaryType"] : this array contains the priamryType and the secondaryType of the actor
												 -The primaryType is the type associated to the sensors.
												 (e.g : primaryType : "Temperature" is associated to the sensor of type "Temperature").
												 
												 -The secondaryType is only used in temporal mode.
												 it can be : -"" (empty):the actor will be on for a period of timeHigh ms
												 			 			 the actor will be off for a period of timeLow ms
															 
															 -"hour" :the actor will be on when the Hour is equal or greater then hourHigh
															 		  the actor will be off when the Hour is equal or greater then hourLow
															 
															 -"minute":the actor will be on when the Minute is equal or greater then minuteHigh
															 		  :the actor will be off when the Minute is equal or greater then minuteLow

															 										   Hour > hourHigh
															 			   the actor will be off when : Hour == hourLow AND Minute >= minuteLow
															 			   								Hour>hourLow
	
	Act[i].low:[rangeLow,timeLow,hourLow,minuteLow] : this array contains the values previously described:
													  -rangeLow is the minimum of the range at which 
													  to activate(deactivate in inverted mode) the actor
													  
													  -timeLow is the time spent off in temporal mode
													  
													  -hourLow is the hour to turn off the actor when secondaryType is hour or hourMinute
													  
													  -minuteLow is the minute to turn off the actor when secondaryType is minute or hourMinute
													  
													  
	Act[i].high:[rangeHigh,timeHigh,hourHigh,minuteHigh]: this array contains the values previously described:
													  -rangeHigh is the maximum of the range at which 
													  to deactivate(activate in inverted mode) the actor
													  
													  -timeHigh is the time spent on in temporal mode
													  
													  -hourHigh is the hour to turn on the actor when secondaryType is hour or hourMinute
													  
													  -minuteHigh is the minute to turn on the actor when secondaryType is minute or hourMinute
		
       
       Note that the coolBoardActorConfig.json contains only one Actor.

  7/mqttConfig.json:
  
  	mqttServer: This is the mqttServer (ip/url) address
  	
  	user: This is the userId
  	
  	bufferSize: This is the memory allocated to the mqtt buffer in bytes
	
	inTopic : this is the topic that the coolBoard subscribes to (receives updates from )
	
	outTopic : this is the topic that the coolBoard will publish to.


  8/rtcConfig.json:
  
  	timeServer: NTP server ip address
	
	localPort: port used to make the NTP request to update the time

	wifiCount: the number of wifis saved in this configuration file

	timeOut:access point timeout in seconds.		
	
	nomad: put this flag to 1(true) to activate nomad mode.
		   in nomad mode : the coolBoard will only try to connect to known WiFis.
		   				   if it fails it will NOT lunch the access point.

### Contribution guidelines ###

For minor fixes of code and documentation, please go ahead and submit a pull request.

Larger changes (rewriting parts of existing code from scratch, adding new functions to the core, adding new libraries) 
should generally be discussed by opening an issue first.

Feature branches with lots of small commits (especially titled "oops", "fix typo", "forgot to add file", etc.) should be squashed before opening a pull request. 
At the same time, please refrain from putting multiple unrelated changes into a single pull request.


### License and credits ###

All files under src/internal are modified versions of existing libraries.
All Credit of the original work goes to their respective authors.

We can only gurantee that we did our best to have everything working on our side.
